# SerStacker
Highly experimental code for planetary images stacking with OpenCV.

This code is intendend mainly for my experimentation only.
It is highly bugged and constantly changed. 

Examples of stacked images on my flickr account :

Examples of raw stacks (saved in TIFF format as 32-bit floats) on my google drive :
